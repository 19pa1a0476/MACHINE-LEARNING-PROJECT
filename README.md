# Machine Learning Project on Decision Tree Algorithm

#  Before running the project, make sure to install all the necessary libraries and dependencies. You can do this by using pip install for libraries such as pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, etc. Ensure that Python is installed on your system.

# To execute the project, run the following command in your terminal or command prompt:"streamlit run iris_app.py"

# This command will initiate the execution of the project, which is based on the Decision Tree algorithm. The project utilizes various libraries and tools, including pandas, numpy, and scikit-learn, to implement the Decision Tree model.

# By following these steps, you can explore and analyze the functionality of the Decision Tree algorithm within the context of this project.
